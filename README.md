A trip along the BQ and N subway lines in Brooklyn is an international culinary adventure. Nicknamed the “Brooklyn Horseshoe”, the subway lines traverse a chain of neighborhoods with extremely high immigrant concentration and diversity.

About half the borough’s foreign-born population lives in the neighborhoods along the Horseshoe, according to the most recent immigration report from the NYC Department of City Planning. They also form almost half of the population of these neighborhoods.

Starting at the northwest tip of the Horseshoe, the neighborhoods of Sunset Park, Borough Park, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst and Gravesend comprise a large Chinese population. Moving south, towards Coney Island and Sheepshead Bay, Russian and Ukraine immigrants dominate. Turning up back north, the Horseshoe traverses Flatbush and Prospect Lefferts Gardens, where the majority of the foreign-born are Haitian and Jamaican, respectively.

The diverse populations engender culinary offerings that are just as varied. We headed to dumpling shops, Russian restaurants, jerk chicken joints to find out the stories and people who serve their community a taste of home. 

<b>Methodology</b>

The project was completed by Alyssa Pagano and Samantha Lee. 

We used data from the NYC Department of City Planning. Their latest report on New York City’s immigrants, <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/nny2013/nny_2013.pdf">The Newest New Yorkers</a>, was published in 2013. One of report’s main findings indicated that Brooklyn now trails closely behind Queens in terms of immigrant population, with almost 1 million immigrants. Moreover, Brooklyn’s immigrant diversity is also described as “remarkable”, with Chinese, Dominicans, Mexicans, Ecuadorians, Jamaicans, Haitians, Russians, Ukrainians, and more. 

Data collected by the department also indicated that many of these immigrants were clustered around the BQ and N subway lines which run through several neighborhoods in Brooklyn. These neighborhoods included Sunset Park and Bensonhurst (mainly Chinese), Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay (mainly Russians and Ukrainians), Flatbush and Prospect Lefferts Gardens (immigrants from the nonhispanic Carribbean). 

Using the neighborhoods as the starting point, we went to each neighborhood and sought out restaurants the served an iconic dish from each ethnic group. Using Yelp, word-of-mouth recommendations and hyperlocal blogs for each neighborhood, we were able to find eateries that a) serve an authentic version of an iconic dish and b) are patronized by people of that ethnic group (not just tourists). We interviewed the owners of each restaurant, and took pictures too. 

We hosted the story on Wordpress. Making the map was one of the biggest headaches. Initially, we used CartoDB but found that it wasn’t attractive/bold enough. Thanks to Miguel, we used Thinglink in the end to add hotspots (of each restaurant’s storefront) to an image of the subway in Brooklyn. That was a more visually effective representation of the food tour. 

Initially, the photos were also presented as slideshows. However, they proved a little distracting alongside the story text. We finally decided to increase the size of the images and make them static. The final effect is bolder, simpler, and more readable.
