This food tour of Brooklyn’s most immigrant-dense neighborhoods along the BQ and N subway lines includes an interactive map, photos of the restaurants and food, and accompanying text. 

A trip along the BQ and N subway lines in Brooklyn is an international culinary adventure. Nicknamed the “Brooklyn Horseshoe”, the subway lines traverse a chain of neighborhoods with extremely high immigrant concentration and diversity.

About half the borough’s foreign-born population lives in the neighborhoods along the Horseshoe, according to the most recent immigration report from the NYC Department of City Planning. They also form almost half of the population of these neighborhoods.

Starting at the northwest tip of the Horseshoe, the neighborhoods of Sunset Park, Borough Park, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst and Gravesend comprise a large Chinese population. Moving south, towards Coney Island and Sheepshead Bay, Russian and Ukraine immigrants dominate. Turning up back north, the Horseshoe traverses Flatbush and Prospect Lefferts Gardens, where the majority of the foreign-born are Haitian and Jamaican, respectively.

The diverse populations engender culinary offerings that are just as varied. We headed to dumpling shops, Russian restaurants, jerk chicken joints to find out the stories and people who serve their community a taste of home.
