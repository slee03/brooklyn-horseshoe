The project was completed by Alyssa Pagano and Samantha Lee. 

<p>We used data from the NYC Department of City Planning. Their latest report on New York City’s immigrants, The Newest New Yorkers, was published in 2013. One of report’s main findings indicated that Brooklyn now trails closely behind Queens in terms of immigrant population, with almost 1 million immigrants. Moreover, Brooklyn’s immigrant diversity is also described as “remarkable”, with Chinese, Dominicans, Mexicans, Ecuadorians, Jamaicans, Haitians, Russians, Ukrainians, and more. </p>
